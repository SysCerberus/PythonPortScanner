# PythonPortScanner
Shitty Port Scanner made by a shitty programmer. Appreciate Feedback

I'm starting to learn networking and hacking and I'm really interested in all of this, tell me what should I change / what is garbage and what i need to implement, would be fantastic. I do this only for fun and for the pleasure of learning this wonderful art called hacking and penetration testing.

And yeah it's real bad, that's why i would love some feedback, to improve it.
